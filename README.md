# Foto Finder, a Turing M1FEE project

This is the Foto Finder project for Turing. The goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of jQuery, event bubbling and propagation, and responsive layouts. The original requirements can be found [here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder.html).

## Getting Started

This is a straightforward application. Download the repository and run `index.html`. This project uses `jQuery 3.2.1`.

### Prerequisites

N/A

### Installing

As mentioned above, simply download the repository and run `index.html`.

## Running the application

To run the app, you will need to _upload_ photos from the `/photos` directory in the repository. This is due to the fact that the images are placed directly into the DOM and assumed to live in the `/photos` directory relative to `index.html`.

## Deployment
